Hi! I am a 2nd year PhD student at Dartmouth College. Currently, my research focuses on answering the following questions: (1) Do para-linguistic features of speech change in the presence of mental illness, if so, can we use voice as a screener, (2) How do we develop robust speech-based machine learning models that generalize across populations, and (3) Can we develop systems that can provide near real-time interventions for emergencies such as suicidal ideation.
