abstract: Artificial intelligence recently experienced a renaissance with the advancement
  of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs require spatially meaningful matrices
  (e.g., image data) with recurring patterns, limiting its applicability to high-throughput
  omics data. We present GIM, a simple, CNN-ready framework for omics data to detect
  both individual and network-level entities of biological importance. Using gene
  expression data, we show that GIM-CNNs can outperform comparable neural networks
  in performance and their design facilitates network-level interpretability. GIM-CNNs
  provide a means to discover novel disease-relevant factors beyond individual genes
  and their expression, factors that are likely missed by standard differential gene
  expression approaches.
